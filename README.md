# Bitcoin-investment-calculator
WiE Google Hackathon Project - An investment calculator WebApp made with AngularJS. The user inputs the amount of money they are willing to invest and the calculator returns an amount that the user could potentially profit depending on the sale prices. Then the calculator will extrapolate a potential future amount of bitcoin and then will provide the user with this data as well.

The current rate of bitcoin is retreived using the BitPay API.
